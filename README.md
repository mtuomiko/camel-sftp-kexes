# camel-sftp-kexes

Demo for a possible bug in Camel SFTP where [keyExchangeProtocols settings](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.0.x/sftp-component.html#_endpoint_query_option_keyExchangeProtocols) leak between endpoints through Jsch. This project uses TestContainers, so running the test requires a container runtime (like Docker).

When running the [RoutesTest](https://github.com/mtuomiko/camel-sftp-kexes/blob/master/src/test/java/net/mtuomiko/kexes/RoutesTest.kt), you can see from the Jsch logging output that both endpoints end up sending the same `JSCH -> client proposal: KEX algorithms: diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,ext-info-c` proposal even though `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1` is only configured on one of them. The default list from Jsch has more options for kex algorithms.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/camel-sftp-kexes-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
